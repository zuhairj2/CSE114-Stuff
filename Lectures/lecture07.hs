Agenda:

- Product types, sum types, recursive types
- Some Haskell features we'll encounter along the way: multiple pattern guards, `where` clauses
- Break/quiz
- Defining and working with abstract syntax trees
- Thoughts on hw0

What can a list be?

- empty (in Haskell, the `[]` constructor)
- an element, together with a list (in Haskell, the `(:)` constructor)

-- A recursive type: it refers to itself!

A data structure for arithmetic expressions

3 + 3
5 * 6
3 + (4 - 2)
(3 + 4) + (7 - 2)
-}

-- Not quite right
-- data ArithExpr = Plus Int Int | Minus Int Int | Times Int Int

-- Better
data ArithExpr = Plus ArithExpr ArithExpr
               | Minus ArithExpr ArithExpr
               | Times ArithExpr ArithExpr

threePlusThree = Plus (Leaf 3) (Leaf 3)

-- 3 + (4 - 2)
biggerExpression :: ArithExpr
biggerExpression = Plus (Leaf 3) (Minus (Leaf 4) (Leaf 2))

-- These ArithExprs are abstract syntax trees, or ASTs for short.

-- We'll be working with ASTs a lot!

-- Of course, they'll get more complicated...
